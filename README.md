This is Adnan's ML project, with Regression and Classification models. 
So for this project, two datasets that were chosen are listed below - 
1) Daily Temperature of Major Cities
2) Healthcare-dataset-stroke-data

For Daily Temperature, Regression models were used, which inlcuded me implementing Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression. Whereas for Stroke prediction, I used SVM Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. 

To access the Random Forest Regression code, check "temperatureprediction_randomforest.py" file
To access the XGBoost code, check "tuning_xgboost.py" file
To access the SVM Classifier code, check "strokeprediction_svm(notuning).py" and "strokeprediction_svm(tuning).py" file
To access the Random Forest Classifier code, check "strokepred_randomforest(notuning).py" and "strokepred_randomforest(tuning).py" file

The datasets are uploaded in the "datasets" folder in this repository. 

Thank you
