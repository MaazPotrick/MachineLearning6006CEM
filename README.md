This is Adnan's ML project, with Regression and Classification models. 
So for this project, two datasets that were chosen are listed below - 
1) Daily Temperature of Major Cities
2) Healthcare-dataset-stroke-data

For Daily Temperature, Regression models were used, which inlcuded me implementing Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression. Whereas for Stroke prediction, I used SVM Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. 

To access the Random Forest Regression code, check "temperatureprediction_randomforest.py" file.

To access the XGBoost code, check "tuning_xgboost.py" file.

To access the SVM Classifier code, check "strokeprediction_svm(notuning).py" and "strokeprediction_svm(tuning).py" file.

To access the Random Forest Classifier code, check "strokepred_randomforest(notuning).py" and "strokepred_randomforest(tuning).py" file.


The datasets are uploaded in the "datasets" folder in this repository. If the datasets in the folder are not able to show up, you can either click on "view raw" in that folder, or visit the link below -
